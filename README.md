# Citric

Citric is an IntelliJ-based plugin that provides framework integration for the [Citrus](https://citrusframework.org/) framework.

It offers various tools to generate and validate Citrus related test code in the following areas, among others:

- Validation and generation of Citrus test methods and TestNG specific `@CitrusParameters`
- Code completion of [Endpoint](https://www.picimako.com/citric/endpoints/) Spring beans,
  [XML and JSON schema](https://www.picimako.com/citric/messaging/) Spring beans,
  [properties in `citrus-application.properties`](https://www.picimako.com/citric/citrus-and-spring-configuration/), message headers and more.
- Basic syntax highlighting for [Citrus functions](https://www.picimako.com/citric/citrus-functions/) and [validation matchers](https://www.picimako.com/citric/messaging/).
- [Language injections](https://www.picimako.com/citric/language-injections/) at various locations
- Validation and conversion of [`@BindToRegistry` methods and fields](https://www.picimako.com/citric/citrus-registry-and-resource-injection/)
- Various Citrus-specific static code analysis checks
- Code folding of certain [containers](https://www.picimako.com/citric/containers/) and Hamcrest condition expressions for easier comprehension of test code
